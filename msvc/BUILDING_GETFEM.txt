Here are some tips in order to build getfem in microsoft visual c++ 2010

- adding a missing .cc file in the libgetfem project: right-click on
the libgetfem entry in the solution explorer, choose "Add", "Existing
document", and select the file.

- adding a new test file: console application, uncheck the
"precompiled headers" entry, check the "empty project" entry.  Add the
test file to the project, open the property manager for the project,
right click on the project, choose "add an existing property sheet"
and select the "common_getfem_settings.vsprops" file.

Building the MATLAB INTERFACE:

right click on the matlab_interface folder in visual C++

in "Configuration Properties/C++/General/Additional Include
Directories" , make sure that the path matches your matlab version
Check also the linker path, which must point also to the correct
matlab folder. It may be simpler to just edit the
matlab_interface.vcxproj in a regular text editor, and just change the
strings in that file instead of using the visual c++ project
properties panel...

Make sure also that you do not try to mix a 64-bit build of getfem
with a 32-bit version of matlab or vice-versa. The current project
file builds only a 32-bit version of getfem , hence you need a 32-bit
version of matlab.  Setting up a 64-bit environment for visual c++
2010 is really painful unfortunately.

the makebindist.sh script collects the various m-files and the
compiled mex file into a zip file that can be use to redistribute a
"ready-to-use" getfem matlab toolbox.
