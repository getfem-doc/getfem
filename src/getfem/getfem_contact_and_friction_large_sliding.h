  /** Adds a large sliding contact with friction brick to the model.
      This brick is able to deal with auto-contact, contact between

      The condition is applied on the variable `varname_u` on the
      boundary corresponding to `region`. `dataname_r` is the augmentation
      parameter of the augmented Lagrangian. `dataname_friction_coeff`
      is the friction coefficient. `mim` is an integration method on the
      boundary. `varname_u` is the variable on which the contact condition
      will be prescribed (should be of displacement type). `multname` is
      a multiplier defined on the boundary which will represent the contact
      force. If no additional boundary or rigid
      obstacle is added, only auto-contact will be detected. Use
      `add_boundary_to_large_sliding_contact_brick` and
      `add_rigid_obstacle_to_large_sliding_contact_brick` to add contact
      boundaries and rigid obstacles.
