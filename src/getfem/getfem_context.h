  /**Deal with interdependencies of objects.

   An object can be in three different states :
     NORMAL  : no change is necessary
     CHANGED : something in the context has changed and the update function
               of the object has to be called.
     INVALID : one of the dependencies desappears, the object is invalid
               and should no longer be used.
  
   add_dependency(ct) : add a dependency to the dependency list.

   touch()            : significate to the dependent objects that something
                        has change in the object. This make the dependent
                        objects to be in the CHANGED state

   context_check()    : check if the object has to be updated. if it is the
                        case it makes first a check to the dependency list
                        and call the update function of the object.
                        (the update function of the dependencies are called
                        before the update function of the current object).

   context_valid()    : says if the object has still a valid context
  
   Remarks :

   - A protection against round dependencies exists. In this case, the
   order of call of the update functions can be arbitrary

   - Detection of context changes is very fast (control the
   state). the touch operation can cover the whole tree of dependent
   object.  But this is the case only for the first touch operation
   because once a dependent object is in the CHANGED state it will not
   be considered by next touch operations.
